### Day 2: Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)


#### Overview

On Day 2, I focused on understanding the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**, which is a process used by the software industry to design, develop, and test high-quality software. The primary goal of SDLC is to deliver a product that meets or exceeds customer expectations while ensuring that the project is completed within the stipulated time and cost.


### Key Concepts Covered:

1. **What is SDLC?**
   - SDLC is a structured process that involves multiple stages to ensure that the software product meets the desired quality and functionality.
   - The end goal is to deliver a high-quality product that meets customer expectations.

2. **Example to Understand SDLC:**
   - **Example.com**: Consider an e-commerce platform where we're developing a product.
   - Example Scenario: Adding a new feature such as a category for men's or women's items.


### Phases of SDLC:

1. **Planning and Requirements** üìù
   - **Planning:** Gathering feedback from customers to identify the needs.
   - **Requirements Documentation:** Writing down all the requirements that need to be fulfilled.

2. **Designing** üé®
   - **High-Level Design:** Architectural design, system architecture, and high-level components.
   - **Low-Level Design:** Detailed design, including detailed algorithms, database design, and other component-level details.

3. **Building (Development)** üõ†Ô∏è
   - **Development:** Writing the code and building the software. 
   - **Code Integration:** Code is integrated into a development environment, which is later pushed to version control systems like Git.

4. **Testing** üß™
   - **Testing:** Code is tested in different environments to ensure it works as intended.
   - **Quality Assurance (QA):** The testing team (QE) ensures that the software is free of bugs and meets the requirements.

5. **Deployment** üöÄ
   - **Production Deployment:** Once testing is successful, the code is deployed to the production environment where it becomes accessible to end-users.

6. **Automation and Efficiency** ‚öôÔ∏è
   - Automation plays a crucial role in quickly promoting the code from development to production, ensuring the deployment process is both fast and reliable.


### Conclusion:

On Day 2, I learned how the SDLC framework provides a systematic approach to software development, ensuring that all aspects, from planning to deployment, are covered methodically. This knowledge forms the foundation for understanding more advanced topics in software engineering and DevOps.
